The various kind of heart diseases are still the world most leading cause of death. The principles of early detection and intervention as will be looks at contain the important enhancement of patient outcome. This project aims at the trying to forecast the potential of a person to develop this disease from possibly related clinical and demographic features concerning age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other significant health indicators. In addition to classifying the data, the project aims at using other machine learning algorithms to differentiate the existing data and make a prediction on the probability of having heart disease while at the same time trying to unravel the explainable factors in the data.

The concept is to offer healthcare professionals from wards an initial risk assessment model that prevents further development and allows for individual management. It is such an approach may help to enhance the decision making in the clinical practices and patientsâ€™ care as well as focus the efforts on the more efficient cardiovascular diseases prevention. Towards this end, the project has sought to offer new perspective on risk assessment of heart diseases that can be used in practical healthcare settings for management of patients.
